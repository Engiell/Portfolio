- 📊 [Final Project Presentation](CS%20250%20Final%20Project.pptx)  
- 🧩 [Milestone Four Analysis](CS%20499%205-2%20Milestone%20Four.docx)  
- 🗂️ [Artifact Package](CS%20499%20Artifact3.zip)

## 💻 Source Code

This project simulates a travel booking system using Python and modular design principles:

- [main.py](main.py): Entry point and system controller  
- [SNHU_TRAVEL.py](SNHU_TRAVEL.py): Core logic for travel management  
- [database.py](database.py): Simulated database operations  
- [service.py](service.py): Service layer for business logic

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Agile sprint planning and documentation  
- Modular Python development with separation of concerns  
- Version control using Git and GitHub  
- Lifecycle analysis and stakeholder communication

## 🔍 Reflection

This project helped me apply agile methodologies in a real-world simulation. I led sprint planning, documented requirements, and built maintainable code with clear separation of responsibilities. The experience reinforced the importance of lifecycle thinking and collaborative development.
