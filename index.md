## Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout the program, I‚Äôve consistently applied modular design principles, secure coding practices, and thorough documentation to every project. My work in courses like CS-320 (Software Testing & QA) and CS-350 (Emerging Systems Architectures) challenged me to build maintainable systems with robust validation logic and scalable architecture. These experiences helped me refine my approach to problem-solving‚Äîalways prioritizing clarity, testability, and ethical impact.

Collaborating in team environments taught me the importance of clear communication and version control. In group projects, I led code reviews and contributed to branching workflows using Git, ensuring that our development process remained transparent and efficient. Communicating with stakeholders‚Äîwhether through technical documentation, milestone reports, or peer feedback‚Äîreinforced my ability to translate complex ideas into actionable insights.

My proficiency in data structures and algorithms was strengthened through hands-on implementation of trie structures, contact management systems, and control flow analysis. These projects demanded not just technical accuracy, but also thoughtful design to ensure performance and readability. In software engineering and database courses, I focused on modular architecture, input validation, and query security‚Äîskills that are essential for building reliable and secure applications.

Security has been a consistent theme across my academic journey. From inline vulnerability documentation in C++ to reverse engineering exercises using NASM and Ghidra, I‚Äôve developed a strong foundation in identifying and mitigating risks. I approach every project with a mindset of ethical responsibility, ensuring that my work upholds both technical excellence and social trust.

üîó Portfolio Overview

The artifacts in this portfolio represent a curated selection of my work across the Computer Science program. Each project was chosen to highlight a specific dimension of my technical capabilities‚Äîfrom automated testing and modular design to system simulation and secure architecture.

    In CS-320, I built and tested a modular Java contact management system, demonstrating my ability to apply test-driven development and exception handling.

    In CS-350, I designed a Python-based thermostat control system, showcasing controller-based logic and iterative enhancement.

    My capstone project integrates these skills into a comprehensive solution, reflecting my growth in architectural thinking, stakeholder communication, and secure development.

Together, these artifacts form a cohesive narrative of my evolution as a computer scientist. They illustrate not only what I‚Äôve built, but how I think‚Äîmethodically, ethically, and with a commitment to clarity and maintainability. I invite you to explore the portfolio and see how each piece contributes to a larger vision of responsible, high-impact software engineering.
