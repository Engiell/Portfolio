## Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout the program, I‚Äôve consistently applied modular design principles, secure coding practices, and thorough documentation to every project. My work in courses like CS-320 (Software Testing & QA) and CS-350 (Emerging Systems Architectures) challenged me to build maintainable systems with robust validation logic and scalable architecture. These experiences helped me refine my approach to problem-solving and always prioritizing clarity, testability, and security.

Collaborating in team environments taught me the importance of clear communication and version control. In group projects, I led code reviews and contributed to branching workflows using Git, ensuring that our development process remained transparent and efficient. Communicating with stakeholders, whether through technical documentation, milestone reports, or peer feedback, reinforced my ability to translate complex ideas into actionable insights.

My proficiency in data structures and algorithms was strengthened through hands-on implementation of trie structures, contact management systems, and control flow analysis. These projects demanded not just technical accuracy, but also thoughtful design to ensure performance and readability. In software engineering and database courses, I focused on modular architecture, input validation, and security. These skills are essential for building reliable and secure applications.

Security has been a consistent theme across my academic journey. From inline vulnerability documentation in C++ to reverse engineering exercises using NASM and Ghidra, I‚Äôve developed a strong foundation in identifying and mitigating risks. I approach every project with a mindset of ethical responsibility, ensuring that my work upholds both technical excellence and social trust.
