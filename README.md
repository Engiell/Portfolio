# Anthony Bradley's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! This repository showcases coursework and projects from my Computer Science studies at SNHU.
---

## Projects

### [CS-250 Project Page](CS-250/index.md)
- Applied agile methodologies and version control using Git
- Led development sprints and documented software requirements
- Built modular, maintainable code with clarity and precision

### CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance
- Practiced test-driven development and automated testing in Python
- Created unit tests and QA pipelines aligned with industry standards
- Reinforced reliability and maintainability in all code artifacts

### CS-350: Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies
- Explored reverse engineering and low-level programming in NASM
- Analyzed binary structures and architectural vulnerabilities
- Strengthened my foundation in secure system-level design

## Technical Competencies

My portfolio highlights a range of skills, including:

- Secure C++ development with inline vulnerability documentation  
- Reverse engineering and binary disassembly using NASM and Ghidra  
- Python scripting for automation and hardware integration  
- Assembly-to-C++ conversion and control flow analysis  
- Git version control and branching workflows  
- Database design with query security and normalization  

These competencies reflect both academic achievement and practical application in freelance and personal projects.

## Collaboration & Integrity

Throughout my coursework, Iâ€™ve prioritized academic honesty and original work. Every solution is my own, with vulnerabilities identified and remediated through documented, step-by-step analysis. Iâ€™ve also collaborated in team environments, led code reviews, and communicated technical findings across disciplinesâ€”skills that prepare me for real-world software development.
