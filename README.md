# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the software, what it's intended to be used for, and the users that will use it. Creating "user stories" help with this by creating a framework that focuses on the user. They help teams collaborate, and help create an over better product for the user with feedback. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-Developing programs can involve several approaches. Teams can use either a waterfall approach or a more agile methodology. Agile processes that I plan to incorporate into my future development work involve communication and involvement. Improving on qualities that improve and promote collaboration with team memebrs, and openly communicate progress during scrum events and meetings.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, being a good team member in software development involves being able to communicate and collaborate effectively. Utilizing experiences as developer and sharing that information with my team. Knowing when to ask for help, and when to reach out for further clarification. Having some personal responsibility, and owning my work.
