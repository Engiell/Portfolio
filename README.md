# CS-350

- Summarize the projects and what problem it was solving?
  
  These two lab projects explored core embedded system techniques using a Raspberry Piâ€”one focused on implementing Pulse  Width Modulation (PWM) to control LED brightness, and the other on using button input and multithreading to manage LED behavior interactively. 
- What did you do particularly well?
  
  In the PWM lab, I had a good grasp of how frequency and duty cycle influence visual LED output, effectively using adjustable parameters to create dynamic lighting effects. The button input lab expanded on this by employing Python's threading module to separate LED behavior from user interaction, allowing real-time responsiveness without blocking other processes.
- Where could you improve?
  
  One improvement area is quality transitions through smoother fading in PWM or refining state transitions and debounce strategies in button handling. This would enhance the overall user experience.
- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  I expanded my toolkit with the use of RPi.GPIO, circuit experimentation, and the application of Python multithreading. I also liked integrating serial communication libraries and leveraging displays in headless environments.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  
  The skills like modular code design, GPIO control, state machine logic, and user input handling will directly transfer to other programs/courses.
- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
  Both projects emphasized the importance of adaptable code. This was done through descriptive functions, parameterization, and structure that supports debugging and scalability.
