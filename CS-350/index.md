title: "CS-350: Emerging Systems Architectures"
---

This page showcases my work in CS-350, where I explored scalable system design, modular architecture, and controller-based logic using Python.

## 📄 Design Documentation

- 📘 [`Milestone Two Enhancement Report`](CS%20499%203-2%20Milestone%20Two%20Enhancement%20One%20Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering.docx): Analysis of architectural improvements and design decisions.

## 💻 Source Code Highlights

### 🌡️ Thermostat Control System

A modular Python application simulating a smart thermostat:

- [`Thermostat.py`](Thermostat.py): Core logic for temperature regulation  
- [`Milestone1.py`](Milestone1.py): Initial implementation and system setup  
- [`Milestone3.py`](Milestone3.py): Final iteration with enhanced control flow  
- [`ThermostatController.zip`](ThermostatController.zip): Packaged controller logic and supporting files

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Modular Python architecture with separation of concerns  
- Controller-based design patterns  
- Iterative development and milestone-based enhancement  
- System simulation and logic validation

## 🔍 Reflection

This course emphasized the importance of scalable design and modular thinking. I built a simulated thermostat system with clear control logic and refined it through milestone-based enhancements. The experience reinforced my ability to design maintainable systems and adapt architecture to evolving requirements.
