This page showcases my work in CS-320, where I applied rigorous testing methodologies, built modular Java applications, and explored data structures and service validation.

## 📄 Project Summary

- 📘 [7-2 Final Project Summary](CS320%207-2%20Project%20Summary.docx): Overview of testing strategies, design decisions, and QA outcomes.

## 💻 Source Code Highlights

### 🔧 Contact Management System
A modular Java application with full unit testing coverage:

- `Contact.java`: Data model for contact records  
- `ContactService.java`: Service layer for managing contacts  
- `ContactTest.java`: Unit tests for the data model  
- `ContactServiceTest.java`: Unit tests for service logic

### 🧪 Updated Implementation
Refined version with improved validation and test coverage:

- `UpdatedContactService.java`  
- `UpdatedContactTest.java`  
- `UpdatedContactServiceTest.java`

### 🌲 Trie Data Structure
Exploration of efficient string storage and retrieval:

- `Trie.java`: Core implementation of the trie  
- `TrieNode.java`: Node structure for trie operations

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- JUnit testing and test-driven development (TDD)  
- Exception handling and input validation  
- Modular design and separation of concerns  
- Data structure implementation and analysis

## 🔍 Reflection

This course deepened my understanding of software reliability and the importance of automated testing. I built systems with robust validation logic and ensured maintainability through clean architecture and thorough test coverage.
