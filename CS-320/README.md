For this enhancement, I chose the Contact Service implementation originally created in CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. The project involved the Contact class for modeling individual records and a ContactService class that handled CRUD operations using a basic hash map keyed by contact ID. As an opportunity for growth in algorithmic thinking and data structure optimization, I enhanced the project by integrating a Trie structure into ContactService to support efficient prefix-based search using contact first names. The enhancement involved building two new support classes, Trie and TrieNode, and adapting the service to manage Trie insertion and dynamic search behavior. 
While the original project was functional. I felt the original implementation offered limited search capabilities and lacked efficient ways to retrieve contacts based on partial data, such as name prefixes. I selected this artifact to showcase my growth in structuring scalable systems and deepening my understanding of data-driven search strategies.
In order to address these limitations from the original project, I introduced a Trie structure into the ContactService class, enabling fast and efficient prefix-based lookup of contact first names. This involved implementing two supporting classes: Trie and TrieNode, which manage character-level branching logic and recursive search behavior. I revised the CRUD methods to be able to interact with both the HashMap and Trie. This helps to ensure any updates
